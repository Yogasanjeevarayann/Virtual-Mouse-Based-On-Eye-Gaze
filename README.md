The iris movement is used to control the mouse movements of a computer. The iris position will be located first and it will be mapped on the computer screen at a certain
position. This can be useful for the physically handicapped individuals to communicate with the computer and also do the work required. With the help of the Iris movement we can move the cursor up and down as well as left and right. It also helps the person to make right and left clicks of the mouse by blinking the eyes which helps to open the files and also close them. This algorithm will also help a person to scroll the pages down and up
